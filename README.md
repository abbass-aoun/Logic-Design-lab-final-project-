# Logic Design Lab Final Project COE 322: Dynamic Logic-Based Switching System

This repository contains the final project for our Logic Design Lab course. The project implements a dynamic switching system where switches control lamps using digital logic circuits, state machines, and memory elements.

## Project Summary

This system allows users to dynamically assign switches to control different lamps based on a selected configuration mode. The design simulates how physical switches, logic gates, and flip-flops work together to achieve flexible switching behavior.

Key features:
.Real-time mapping of switches to lamps
.Support for multiple configurations
.Clocked memory using flip-flops
.Finite State Machine (FSM) for control logic

## Logic Design Concepts Used

.  Combinational Logic & Truth Tables  
.  Sequential Logic (JK/RS/D Flip-Flops)  
.  Finite State Machine (FSM) Design  
.  Karnaugh Maps for Boolean simplification  
.  Clocked memory and edge-triggered transitions  
.  LED/Lamp simulation

## Tools & Technologies

. Logic Simulator: *Logisim / Quartus / Multisim* (edit this)
. Language: *Verilog / VHDL* (if applicable)
. Platform: *Breadboard & ICs / Software Simulation* (edit this)
. Documentation: State diagrams, circuit schematics, truth tables


## How It Works

1. System starts in `IDLE` mode
2. User selects a configuration using input controls
3. FSM determines switch-to-lamp mapping
4. Logic gates activate lamps based on switch states
5. State is stored using edge-triggered flip-flops
