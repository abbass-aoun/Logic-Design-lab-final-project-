# Logic Design Lab Final Project

This project demonstrates a  digital logic circuit using four switches to control four LEDs in a defined sequence. It was created as a final project for a Logic Design Lab course using Quartus II.

## Features
- 4 input switches.
- 4 output LEDs.
- LED behavior depends on specific switch combinations and sequential logic.
- Designed and simulated using Quartus II
- Tested on an physical breadboard.
