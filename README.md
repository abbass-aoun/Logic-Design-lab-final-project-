# Logic-Design-lab-final-project-
This project controls four LEDs using four input switches based on a specific logic sequence. Designed and implemented in Quartus II, the system lights up the LEDs according to the combination or order of switch activations. It demonstrates core concepts in digital logic and hardware simulation using an FPGA board.
