# Logic Design Lab Final Project COE 322: Dynamic Logic-Based Switching System

This repository contains the final project for our Logic Design Lab course. The project implements a dynamic switching system where switches control lamps using digital logic circuits, state machines, and memory elements.

## Project Summary

This system allows users to dynamically assign switches to control different lamps based on a selected configuration mode. The design simulates how physical switches, logic gates, and flip-flops work together to achieve flexible switching behavior.

**Key Features:**
- Real-time mapping of switches to lamps  
- Support for multiple configurations  
- Clocked memory using flip-flops  
- Finite State Machine (FSM) for control logic

## Logic Design Concepts Used

-  Combinational Logic & Truth Tables  
-  Sequential Logic (JK/RS/D Flip-Flops)  
-  Finite State Machine (FSM) Design  
-  Karnaugh Maps for Boolean simplification  
-  Clocked memory and edge-triggered transitions  
-  LED/Lamp simulation

---

## Tools & Technologies

- Logic Simulator:Altera Quartus II
- Seven Segment display
- 74LS series IC components
- 555 timer
- Breadboards
- Resistors & Wires
- LEDs
- Mechanical switches

## How It Works

1. System starts in IDLE mode
2. User selects a configuration using input controls
3. FSM determines switch-to-lamp mapping
4. Logic gates activate lamps based on switch states
5. State is stored using edge-triggered flip-flops

## Results

The dynamic logic-based switching system was successfully implemented and tested using [insert your simulation tool, e.g., Logisim]. All key functionalities performed as expected, including:

- Real-time switch-to-lamp mapping based on user input configurations  
- Correct operation of flip-flops to store and maintain system states  
- Accurate state transitions within the finite state machine (FSM)  
- Successful simulation of lamp activation and deactivation according to the designed logic
